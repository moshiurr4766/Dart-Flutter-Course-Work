🚀 Dart Learning Path (Beginner → Advanced)
1. Foundations of Dart
✅ Goal: Understand core syntax & programming basics

What Dart is & why it’s used (esp. with Flutter)

Installing Dart SDK or using DartPad

Variables & data types

Operators

Control flow (if/else, loops)

Functions

Null safety

🎯 Milestone:

Write simple programs (calculator, number guessing game, string manipulator).





2. Working With Collections
✅ Goal: Become fluent with Dart data structures

Lists, Sets, Maps

Iteration techniques

Higher-order functions: map, where, reduce, fold

Spread operators and collection if/for

🎯 Milestone:

Build a small CLI app that reads input and manages a list (e.g., todo list).




3. Object-Oriented Dart
✅ Goal: Build structured programs

Classes & objects

Constructors

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstract classes & interfaces

Enums & extensions

Mixins

🎯 Milestone:

Create a mini-library (e.g., Shape → Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) with methods.




4. Asynchronous Programming
✅ Goal: Handle real-world asynchronous tasks

Futures

async / await

Streams

Error handling

🎯 Milestone:

Simulate API calls and handle data streams (e.g., live counter, fake chat).
